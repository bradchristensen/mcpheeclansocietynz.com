<h3>The Origin of the New Zealand Clan Society</h3>The McPhee Family Clan Society of New Zealand was formed in response to a worldwide call by the late Dr Earle Douglas MacPhee of Vancouver, Canada, in the early 1970's to reactivate Clan Macfie.<br />
<br />
The Clan Society was initially formed in Papakura in 1974 with 30 members of the family of Belle McPhee Brew the founder of the Clan Society.  The Clan Society was accepted as a Society within the international Clan Macfie in 1984.  The word 'Family' was removed from the name of the Clan Society in 1993. <br />
<br />
Today the New Zealand Clan Society has some 40 members and a membership over 5000 through affiliation of other Societies to the international Clan Macfie.<br /><br />
<h3>Clan Society Management</h3>Apart from the AGM the Society does not hold regular meetings.  The AGM is held during the closest weekend to 27 May which has been set aside as International Clan Macfie Day.  The evening dinner, a social gathering and celebration is always well attended and on occasions members from other clans also attend.  
The Clan Society receives an invitation to attend regular Scottish events held at other venues throughout the country.  A Clan banner is displayed at these events at which the Society participates.<br />
